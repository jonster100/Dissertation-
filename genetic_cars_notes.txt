notes - 
index.js in src file is the main script that runs the genetic algorithm
it calls the manage-round.js script in cw_newRound function in index.js

generation-config which is passed to the manage-round.js is the config file which contains parent selection, inbreeding selection.

the manage-round.js returns generationState variable which is used a lot.

result/score passed to manage-round.js is the list of cars

	- need to know how new cars are created in the process and how selection is done/scored/ranked.
